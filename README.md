# 🛡️ CodeGuardian: AI-Powered Software Quality & Ethics Monitor

## 📌 Overview

**CodeGuardian** is an intelligent developer tool that analyzes software codebases for:
- **Code quality issues**
- **Security vulnerabilities**
- **Ethical red flags**
- **Regulatory non-compliance**

Using static analysis, AI/NLP models, and custom rule engines, CodeGuardian provides actionable feedback to developers, helping them build cleaner, safer, and more responsible software.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔍 **Code Quality Scanner:** Detects anti-patterns, poor practices, and maintainability issues.
- 🔐 **Security & Privacy Analyzer:** Flags insecure code and improper data handling (e.g., PII leaks).
- 🧠 **Ethics Validator:** Uses AI to identify biased logic, discriminatory filters, and unethical code patterns.
- 📋 **Regulatory Compliance Checker:** Highlights code that may violate HIPAA, GDPR, FDA software guidelines, etc.
- 💬 **Smart Recommendations:** Provides AI-generated suggestions and best practices for improvement.
